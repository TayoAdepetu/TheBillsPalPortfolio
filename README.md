<h2>A Little About BillsPal</h2>

<p>BillsPal is a technology that lets people launch their own bills payment websites and mobile apps (both Android and iOS) within 24 hours.</p>

<p>Via BillsPal, you can have your own website and mobile application where you sell Airtime, Data, Prepaid and Postpaid Electricity Subscription, Cable TV Subscription, WAEC and JAMB Result Checker, Convert Airtime to Cash, and others.</p>

<h2>Multiple API Providers Per Product</h2>

<p>Interestingly, you will be able to buy all these products (data, airtime, electricity, Cable TV, etc) from the cheapest API providers (Wholesalers) in Nigeria. We ensure this by designing the technology in such a way that you are able to switch from one API provider to another by just clicking a button.</p>

<p>This means you can have access to four wholesale sellers for airtime alone. This way, you can easily connect your website and mobile application to any of the four API providers at anytime so that all the airtime transactions being carried out by users on your website and mobile app are done via that particular API provider.</p>

<p>It means you can switch from one wholesaler to another when you notice that one is cheaper than the other, the customer service for one is better, the network service for opne is better, and so on. This means you have all the power.</p>

<p>This also applies to other products like data, electricity, etc. You can choose who you're buying from per time, and what you choose for a particular product can be different from what you choose from the other product. For example, you don't have to buy your data from the same Wholesaler that's selling airtime to you. You can change anything at anytime, depending on what's best for your business.</p>

<h2>Run Affiliate Program</h2>

<p>You're able to run affiliate programs on your websites and mobile apps easily. You can specify a specific amount that a user will make when they bring someone who patronizes you.</p>

<h2>Recruit Resellers</h2>

<p>BillsPal lets you upgrade some users to Resellers. Resellers are able to buy products (data, airtime, electricity, etc) from your website or mobile app at cheaper prices so that they can resell to their friends.</p>

<p>This means you are able to let your business become other people's business, which means you start making more sales.</p>

<p>Interestingly, you can also charge a one-time account upgrade fee on Resellers so as to ensure only serious people who are ready to make money selling your products are able to upgrade their accounts.</p>

<h2>Continuous Technical Support and Maintenance</h2>

<p>The BillsPal Developer team will always be ready to help you make changes as needed, either free of charge or at doscount fee.</p>
